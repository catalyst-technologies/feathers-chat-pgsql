# FeathersJS Chat PostgreSQL

This project is a fork from [Feathers-Chat](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat) with few modifications.
We've seen that there were no examples that deals with other database systems like PostgreSQL.

So we decided to fork it and do some modifications.

## Installation Guide
* clone the repository ```git clone git@github.com:feathersjs/feathers-chat.git```
* install node packages ```npm install```
* prepare database. Create the database in PostgreSQL then configure the project to connect to that database. You can find the connection settings in ```config/default.json```
* run the program ```npm start```
